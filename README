## Cuda toolkit + drivers install helper for CentOS based systems
This script is talored to run on Amazon Linux AMIs.

# Install
`./install_required`

This immediately opens /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo config file for editing in Vim. This is so you can modify the lines where `enabled=0`. Change `0` to `1` for all of them.

That's it, from there all the dependencies get installed, along with cuda itself.
